# MNIST &amp; Fashion MNIST
The current repository contains a common task within the scope of Computer Vision field, Image Detection, such as:

- MNIST
- Fashion MNIST

The MNIST is a useful for those who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data.

# About the Datasets
## MNIST
The *MNIST* dataset contains 70,000 grayscale small images (28x28) of labeled handwritten digits, from *0 - 9*. This problem is often called as the "Hello World" of *Machine Learning* because anyone who learns *Machine Learning* tackles this problem at any time.  

Further information about the dataset can be found in the following webpages:

Some examples of the digits are shown below.
