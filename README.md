# MNIST &amp; Fashion MNIST
The current repository contains a common task within the scope of Computer Vision field, Image Detection, such as:

- MNIST
- Fashion MNIST

The MNIST is a useful for those who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data.

# About the Datasets
## MNIST
The *MNIST* dataset contains 70,000 grayscale small images (28x28) of labeled handwritten digits, from *0 - 9*. This problem is often called as the "Hello World" of *Machine Learning* because anyone who learns *Machine Learning* tackles this problem at any time.

## Fashion MNIST
The *Fashion-MNIST* dataset contains 70,000 labeled article images. Each image is a 28×28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes, these classes are listed below.

|Class|Label|
|:---:|:----|
|0|T-shirt/top|
|1|Trouser|
|2|Pullover|
|3|Dress|
|4|Coat|
|5|Sandal|
|6|Shirt|
|7|Sneaker|
|8|Bag|
|9|Ankle boot|
